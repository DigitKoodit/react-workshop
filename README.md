### Note

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Create React App does a lot of stuff under the hood. It's currently widely regarded as the best way to get started with a new react application.

You can find the guide for working with Create React App [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
